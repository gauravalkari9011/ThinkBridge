# Usability/UI Suggestions :
*  UI of page should be simple with proper spacing between the fields.
* Hint should be provided under text field which helps user to correct the entered data.
* Generate OTP button should be disabled if mobile number is not entered. 
* After selecting Payment options, Amount should also be display. 
* Registration Fee(Rs), Connection Fee(Rs), Security Deposit(Rs) and Total Charges(Rs) fields should be read only.


# Functionality Issues : 

* Dummy OR corrupt image should not get displayed under View Photo here and View Signature here until it is not uploaded by user
* Mobile number is not accpeted if user enters 10 digits. User has to add +91(country code) then only it is getting accepted.
* Validation message are inconsistent. Few are in capital letter and few are in lower letter.
* After clicking on Reset all, Aadhar card number,Test Report Number and Name of the Licensed Electrical Contractor(LEC) are not getting removed.
* Upload photo/ occupancy/ signature/ identity proof don't have a file validation which comes under upload required documents  
* Text 'No' is displaying as 'N0' which is given under 'Whether power supply address is same as billing address' section.
* Textbox field of 'Title/ First name' are not proper aligned
* Text 'Supply Voltage' and 'Purpose of Supply' are not properly aligned
* Selecting option from dropdown of 'Supply Voltage', page is getting scrolled up.
* Text fields 'Road name'and'area'are displayed when power supply address is not same as billing address which is inconsistent with 'Select Area' and 'Select Road name' under Power Supply Address.
